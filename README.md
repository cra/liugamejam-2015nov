## Kangaroo Run

This is a short game I developed during [2015 Liu Game Jam](https://www.facebook.com/events/1638233146445609/) Nov13-15

The jam theme was "Battle Roundabout". 

## Backstory

When I was in Australia a few years ago, I saw there a lot of dead kangaroos on the road :(
In this game you play a really concious kangaroo that has to control his intentions to actually move. The objective is to press the arrow keys in a specific order and reach the end of the screen

## Tools and assets

This game was made using [LÃ¶ve2D framework](http://love2d.org), the wallaby picture was found in a random reddit thread, the road background and the "The End" image was made using [aseprite](http://aseprite.org) pixel art editor.

The sound sample for the end credits ("Stayin' Alive" by BeeGees) was taken from the [corresponding wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stayin%27_Alive) on the topic.
